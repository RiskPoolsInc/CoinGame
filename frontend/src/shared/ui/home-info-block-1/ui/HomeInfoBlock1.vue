            RiskPools is a risk management protocol built on UBIX Network. It allows you to earn money by taking on risks, hedging risks, or minimizing them. The key use cases for RiskPools are gaming, trading, insurance, forecasting, and betting.
            <br /><br />
            At the heart of the protocol are risk pools, a type of liquidity pool. Any random economic process associated with risk can serve as the basis for a risk pool with its own token. You can supply liquidity to the pool, thus taking on the risk yourself, or hedge your risk.
            <br /><br />
            If the risk event you are hedging against materializes, you receive a sum of money from the pool. If the event doesnâ€™t occur, the reward goes to the liquidity providers (pool holders).
            <br /><br />
            What makes RiskPools so powerful is that you can add data about a source of risk in a standardized way and create your own pools.
